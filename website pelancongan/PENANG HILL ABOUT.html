      <h3>&nbsp;About Us</h3>
      <div>Penang Hill is the oldest colonial hill station established by the British during their time in Malaysia. Explored during the late 18th century, a horse trail was cut from the Waterfall Gardens (present-day Penang Botanic Gardens) to the summit of the hilly spine of Penang, allowing the British to escape from the chaos in George Town to a cooler climate on the hill.</div>
      <div>The Penang Hill Corporation was formed to manage this marvellous hill. We are a corporation that was formed by multiple background &amp; expertise personnel. Our main objective is to develop and maintain the hill as a tourism site and aiming to become a world-class tourism hot spot.</div>
      <p>Penang Hill Corporation was established in 2009 through an enactment passed by the Penang State Legislative Assembly. It was formed with the primary objectives of managing the funicular system and the development of Penang Hill. <br>
        <br>
        Our vision is to make Penang Hill the hill resort of choice in Malaysia. So far we have succeeded with more and more tourists coming up to Penang Hill. In 2018, we hit a record of 1.74 million passengers. <br>
        <br>
        Penang Hill is the first and oldest hill resort in South East Asia and one of the iconic tourist destinations of Penang. Richly endowed with mostly untouched virgin tropical rainforest, it is home to a large variety of flora and fauna. You will find the tiger orchid, the &ldquo;Queen of the Night&rdquo; flower; the dusky-leaf monkey, the giant black squirrel, a greater racket-tailed drongo and the beautiful and colourful wild pigeons. The summit is dotted with several heritage buildings built during the colonial era. <br>
        <br>
        The 5-minute comfortable ride up the hill in the funicular train is truly an exhilarating experience. The Penang funicular train system has achieved several firsts in the Malaysian Book of Records, namely the Longest Funicular Track in Asia, First Funicular Train On The Slope and the Longest Single Coach. The train is maintained daily to ensure safety and comfort for our tourists.<br>
        <br>
        Penang Hill Corporation, being the custodian of Penang Hill, takes upon itself the responsibility of conserving our natural ecosystem and preserving our heritage in Penang Hill. Facilities are constantly being upgraded to provide more attractions to nature lovers, the young at heart and the energetic ones. Trekking through the jungle trails will make you close to nature. <br>
        <br>
        The opening of the new &ldquo;The Habitat&rdquo; is an eye-opener which breaks new ground in introducing to the layman the amazing wonders and beauty of our 130 million-year-old rainforest. Sipping tea in the café and watching the scenic George Town from 750 meters above will make you closer to nature <br>
        <br>
        A visit to Penang is incomplete without a visit to Penang Hill. Come and enjoy the clean, cool fresh air and the serene natural environment of Penang Hill. Your visit will be a memorable one. <br>
        <br>
      Thank you.</p>
